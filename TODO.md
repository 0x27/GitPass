# Todo List
* Better exception handling and overall code cleanup.
* Master Password Change Functionality.
* Password Expiry (after 1 month from INSERT/UPDATE, alert user to "please change me").
* Have Master Password Change trigger an alert that you should change other passwords as well.
* Crypto review.
* Probably another code review/cleanup.
* More/Better documentation.
* Python3 Support "sometime, maybe".
